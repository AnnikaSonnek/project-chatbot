The assignment was to create a chatbot using Javascript. In order for the chatbot to work we were supposed to use functions, if-statements, variables and forms. The conversation with the bot was supposed to flow easily and the user was supposed to be able to make choices. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started by reading the instructions of the project and then I started looking at the code in order to figure out how it worked. I wrote up some user options, like a menu, and after that started writing the conversation between the user and the bot. 

I was able to have the user enter their name, press buttons but when I tried to make the select (drop down menu) to work I got stuck. My problem was that at first I didn't understad from what attribute the value was added to. I was also unsure about how the EventListener actually work (this was before Thursday's lecture). I ended up asking a friend for help and he helped me figure it out. It also turned out that I had forgot that you had to send variables in a specific order into the functions. Since I had forgot that my if-statement later in the code didn't work. My friend helped me in a pedagogic way to that I could figure it out. I really felt like I learned something new!

I had trouble deploying the site to Netifly and I thought it had to do with the branch being named main and not master (like it was before) so therefore my commits might have disappeared. Until next time I will now NOT to mess with the branches! ;) But I assure you that I commited A LOT during this project! 

In this assignment I used: functions, conditional statements, variables, EventListeners, HTML forms (select, textfield and buttons). I also added placeholders for the textfields, emojis and some other styling as well.
